//Given a balanced parentheses string s, return the score of the string.
//The score of a balanced parentheses string is based on the following rule:

//"()" has score 1.
//AB has score A + B, where A and B are balanced parentheses strings.
//(A) has score 2 * A, where A is a balanced parentheses string.
